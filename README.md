# Flatiron_School_DS_Wine_Final
My notebooks and data for my final project in my data science class completed 12/11/2018. Looks at predicting the price of wine based on points rating and geographic data.
The data set was too big to upload here, but can be accessed via this link:https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/version/4#winemag-data_first150k.csv 
I used the first 150K data set in my project.
